# Advent of Code

This is an autogen for an advent of code project. We all want to just sit back and focus on actualyl writing the code, so this should auto build dir structure and pull the input.

You'll need to populate ```secrets/.cookie``` and ```secrets/.twilio``` following the template put there.

Also you'll need to put these in a crontab. If you're on windows... well... sucks to suck.
